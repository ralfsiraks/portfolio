    <p>A clear type scale did more for readability than any redesign. Once headings, body, and UI labels had roles and sizes, everything else snapped into place.</p>
    <h2>Simple stack</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clamp-based sizes for fluid steps</li>
      <li>Moderate line-height for body (1.5–1.7)</li>
      <li>Consistent margins above headings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typography is the real layout engine.</p>
