    <p>Smooth UX feels <em>predictable</em>. Not fast for the sake of it, not slow to look fancy. Predictable means your brain can anticipate where elements go and why.</p>
    <h2>Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>State changes don’t surprise users</li>
      <li>Focus moves logically (keyboard included)</li>
      <li>Durations match the weight of the action</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When motion tells the story, the UI feels effortless.</p>
