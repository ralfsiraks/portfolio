    <p>“Smooth” isn’t the same as “slow”. It’s predictable timing, consistent motion curves, and transitions that explain what just happened. If an element teleports, the user’s mental model breaks. If it glides too long, it feels unresponsive.</p>
    <h2>What helped</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the same easing for families of interactions</li>
      <li>Shorter durations than you think—200–400ms is plenty</li>
      <li>Animate opacity and transform, avoid layout thrash</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Clarity first, then flair.</p>
