    <p>I rebuilt my portfolio to reduce friction. Smaller surface area, faster iterations, and components I can reuse everywhere. It also let me tighten typography, spacing, and animation into a consistent system instead of a pile of one-offs.</p>
    <h2>Focus areas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear page structure with a persistent layout</li>
      <li>Reusable modal and card patterns</li>
      <li>Smoother motion with short, consistent timings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal wasn’t fancy tech—just finishing more ideas, faster.</p>
